#### Hankel Adaptative Imputation via Latent Space for Network Throughput Time Series Forecasting (HAIL)
This repository contains the official implementation and experimental results for HAIL (Hankel Adaptative Imputation via Latent Space), a novel imputation method developed for network throughput time series forecasting.

#### About The Project
This project introduces and evaluates the HAIL algorithm, a new technique designed to handle missing data in high-variance network performance time series. The method leverages structured matrices (Hankel) and latent space representations to achieve robust and adaptive imputation.

The experiments in this repository are performed using network throughput data from the GEANT 2023 datasets to validate the method's effectiveness against other state-of-the-art imputation techniques.

This Repository Contains:
- The Python implementation of the HAIL algorithm.

- Scripts to run the imputation experiments.

- Baseline models used for comparison.

- Jupyter Notebooks for data analysis and visualization of results.
